//: ## Calculations
//: You can use a playground like a calculator. Type in the math problem you want solved and the results sidebar shows the answer, or the _result_, of the calculation.
//:
//: You can use the plus `+` and minus `-` signs for addition and subtraction, just as youâ€™d expect:
94 + 59 + 290

198680 - 3383

//: For multiplication, use the asterisk `*` :
9 * 14833
//: For division, use the slash `/` :
27884 / 2
//: For grouping, use parenthesis `( )` :
(32840 + 59340 + 465940) / 3
//: - experiment:\
//: Practice using the playground like a calculator.
//: Edit some of the existing expressions and add a few of your own.
//: Notice that every time you make a change the results are updated in the sidebar.
//:
//: Next, learn how programmers can leave notes in code.
