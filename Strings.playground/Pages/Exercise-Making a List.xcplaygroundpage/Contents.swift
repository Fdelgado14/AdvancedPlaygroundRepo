 ## Exercise: Making a List
 
 Lists are great. Here are some constants describing some of the things youâ€™ve learned about strings so far:

 - experiment: Make a new string constant that is a list of the things youâ€™ve learned, with each entry on a new line. Make sure you add the result to the playground page so that you can see the list properly.
